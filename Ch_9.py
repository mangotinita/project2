# # In Python, an object is essentially any entity that has a state (data) and behavior (functionality). Python, being
# # an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, treats everything as an object, including things like numbers, strings,
# # lists, and functions.
# from copyreg import pickle

# # Key Characteristics of an Object:
# # State (Attributes): The state of an object is represented by its attributes or properties. These are variables that
# # store data related to the object.
# # Behavior (Methods): Behavior refers to the functions (methods) associated with the object that define what it can do.
# # Identity: Every object has a unique identity, which can be checked with the id() function in Python. The identity is
# # essentially the objectâ€™s address in memory.
# # Example of Creating an Object:
# # python
# # class Car:
# #     def __init__(self, brand, model):
# #         self.brand = brand
# #         self.model = model
# #
# #     def display_info(self):
# #         print(f"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}")
# #
# # # Creating an object of the Car class
# # my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")

# # # Accessing attributes
# # print(my_car.brand)  # Output: Toyota

# # # Calling methods
# # my_car.display_info()  # Output: Car: Toyota Corolla
# # Here, my_car is an object (or instance) of the Car class. It has attributes like brand and model, and a method
# # display_info() that defines its behavior.

# # give some of the dictionaries method

# # In Python, dictionaries are key-value pairs and come with various built-in methods to interact with the data they hold
# # Here are some common dictionary methods:

# # 1. dict.get(key, default)
# # Returns the value for the specified key. If the key is not found, it returns the default value (or None if no default
# # is specified).

# # my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
# # print(my_dict.get('name'))  # Output: Alice
# # print(my_dict.get('gender', 'Not Specified'))  # Output: Not Specified

# # 2. dict.keys()
# # Returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys in the dictionary.

# # print(my_dict.keys())  # Output: dict_keys(['name', 'age'])

# # 3. dict.values()
# # Returns a view object that displays all the values in the dictionary.
# # print(my_dict.values())  # Output: dict_values(['Alice', 25])

# # 4. dict.items()
# # Returns a view object that displays a list of all the key-value pairs as tuples.
# # print(my_dict.items())  # Output: dict_items([('name', 'Alice'), ('age', 25)])

# # 5. dict.update(other_dict)
# # Updates the dictionary with elements from another dictionary or from key-value pairs. If a key already exists,
# # it will update the value.

# # my_dict.update({'age': 26, 'gender': 'Female'})
# # print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 26, 'gender': 'Female'}
# # 6. dict.pop(key, default)
# # Removes the specified key and returns its value. If the key is not found, it returns the default value (or raises a
# # KeyError if no default is provided).

# # age = my_dict.pop('age')
# # print(age)  # Output: 26
# # print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'gender': 'Female'}

# # 7. dict.popitem()
# # Removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair as a tuple. Raises a KeyError if the dictionary is empty.

# # item = my_dict.popitem()
# # print(item)  # Output: ('gender', 'Female')
# # print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice'}

# # 8. dict.clear()
# # Removes all items from the dictionary, leaving it empty.

# # my_dict.clear()
# # print(my_dict)  # Output: {}

# # 9. dict.copy()
# # Returns a shallow copy of the dictionary.

# # original_dict = {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30}
# # new_dict = original_dict.copy()
# # print(new_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30}

# # 10. dict.fromkeys(iterable, value)
# # Creates a new dictionary with keys from the iterable and all values set to the specified value (or None if not
# # provided).

# # keys = ['name', 'age', 'gender']
# # new_dict = dict.fromkeys(keys, 'Unknown')
# # print(new_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Unknown', 'age': 'Unknown', 'gender': 'Unknown'}

# # 9.3 Suppose 'start' : 1472 is an element in a dictionary.
# # What is the key? What is the value?

# # Example dictionary
# example_dict = {'start': 1472}

# # Key: 'start'
# # Value: 1472
# print(f"Key: 'start', Value: {example_dict['start']}")

# # 9.4 Suppose a dictionary named employee has been created.
# # What does the following statement do?

# employee = {}
# employee['id'] = 54321
# print(f"Employee ID: {employee['id']}")  # It adds/updates the 'id' key in the dictionary.

# # 9.5 What will the following code display?
# stuff = {1: 'aaa', 2: 'bbb', 3: 'ccc'}
# print(stuff[3])  # Output will be 'ccc'

# # 9.6 How can you determine whether a key-value pair exists in a dictionary?

# # Example check for key existence
# if 2 in stuff:
#     print("Key 2 exists in the dictionary.")
# else:
#     print("Key 2 does not exist in the dictionary.")

# # 9.7 Suppose a dictionary named inventory exists.
# # What does the following statement do?

# inventory = {654: "item1", 123: "item2"}
# del inventory[654]  # This deletes the key-value pair with key 654 from the dictionary.

# # 9.8 What will the following code display?

# stuff = {1: 'aaa', 2: 'bbb', 3: 'ccc'}
# print(len(stuff))  # Output will be 3 because there are three key-value pairs in the dictionary.
#
# # 9.9 What will the following code display?

# stuff = {1: 'aaa', 2: 'bbb', 3: 'ccc'}
# for k in stuff:
#     print(k)  # This will print the keys: 1, 2, 3 (each on a new line).

# # 9.10 What is the difference between the dictionary methods pop and popitem?
# # pop(key) removes and returns the value associated with a specific key.
# # popitem() removes and returns the last key-value pair added to the dictionary.

# # 9.11 What does the items method return?
# # items() returns a view object containing the dictionary's key-value pairs as tuples.
# print(stuff.items())  # Output: dict_items([(1, 'aaa'), (2, 'bbb'), (3, 'ccc')])

# # 9.12 What does the keys method return?
# # keys() returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys.
# print(stuff.keys())  # Output: dict_keys([1, 2, 3])

# # 9.13 What does the values method return?
# # values() returns a view object that displays a list of all the values.
# print(stuff.values())  # Output: dict_values(['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc'])

# # 9.14 Assume the following list exists:
# names = ['Chris', 'Katie', 'Joanne', 'Kurt']
# # Write a statement that uses a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary
# # in which each element contains a name from the names list as its key,
# # and the length of that name as its value.

# name_lengths = {name: len(name) for name in names}
# print(name_lengths)  # Output: {'Chris': 5, 'Katie': 5, 'Joanne': 6, 'Kurt': 4}
#
# # 9.15 Assume the following dictionary exists:
# phonebook = {
#     'Chris': '919-555-1111',
#     'Katie': '828-555-2222',
#     'Joanne': '704-555-3333',
#     'Kurt': '919-555-3333'
# }
# # Write a statement that uses a dictionary comprehension to create a second dictionary
# # containing the elements of phonebook that have a value starting with '919'.
#
# filtered_phonebook = {name: number for name, number in phonebook.items() if number.startswith('919')}
# print(filtered_phonebook)  # Output: {'Chris': '919-555-1111', 'Kurt': '919-555-3333'}

# # 9.2 Noninteractive checkpoint questions from the book
# 9.16 Are the elements of a set ordered or unordered?
# Answer: Unordered.

# 9.17 Does a set allow you to store duplicate elements?
# Answer: No, sets do not allow duplicate elements.

# 9.18 How do you create an empty set?
# Answer: myset = set()

# 9.19 After the following statement executes, what elements will be stored in the myset set?
# myset = set('Jupiter')

# 9.20 After the following statement executes, what elements will be stored in the myset set?
# myset = set(25)
# Answer: This will raise a TypeError because the set() function expects an iterable, and 25 is not iterable.

# 9.21 After the following statement executes, what elements will be stored in the myset set?
# myset = set([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4])
# Answer: {'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', ' '}

# 9.22 After the following statement executes, what elements will be stored in the myset set?
# myset = set([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4])
# Answer: {1, 2, 3, 4}

# 9.23 After the following statement executes, what elements will be stored in the myset set?
# myset = set(['www', 'xxx', 'yyy', 'zzz'])
# Answer: {'www', 'xxx', 'yyy', 'zzz'}

# 9.24 How do you determine the number of elements in a set?
# Answer: Use the len() function. Example: len(myset)

# 9.25 After the following statement executes, what elements will be stored in the myset set?
# myset = set([10, 9, 8])
# myset.update([1, 2, 3])
# print(myset)

# myset = set([10, 9, 8])
# myset.update([10, 9, 8])
# print(myset)

# # 9.26 After the following statement executes, what elements will be stored in the myset set?
# myset = set([10, 9, 8])
# myset.update('abc')
# print(myset)

# 9.27 What is the difference between the remove and discard methods?
# Answer: remove(): Removes the specified element. If the element is not found, it raises a KeyError.
# discard(): Removes the specified element. If the element is not found, it does not raise an error.

# 9.28 How can you determine whether a specific element exists in a set?
# Use the in operator.
# Example:
# if 5 in myset:
#     print("5 is in the set")

# # 9.29 After the following code executes, what elements will be members of set3?

# # 9.29 After the following code executes, what elements will be members of set 3?
# set1 = set([10, 20, 30])
# set2 = set([100, 200, 300])

# True or False
# The keys in a dictionary must be mutable objects.
#
# Answer: False. Dictionary keys must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
# Dictionaries are not sequences.
#
# Answer: True. Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs and do not maintain sequential order.
# A tuple can be a dictionary key.
#
# Answer: True. Tuples are immutable, so they can be used as dictionary keys.
# A list can be a dictionary key.
#
# Answer: False. Lists are mutable, so they cannot be used as dictionary keys.
# The dictionary method popitem does not raise an exception if it is called on an empty dictionary.
#
# Answer: False. popitem raises a KeyError if called on an empty dictionary.
# The following statement creates an empty dictionary:
#
# python
# Copy code
# mydct = {}
# Answer: True. {} creates an empty dictionary.
# The following statement creates an empty set:
#
# python
# Copy code
# myset = ()
# Answer: False. () creates an empty tuple, not a set. An empty set is created using set().
# Sets store their elements in an unordered fashion.
#
# Answer: True. Sets are unordered collections.
# You can store duplicate elements in a set.
#
# Answer: False. Sets do not allow duplicate elements.
# The remove method raises an exception if the specified element is not found in the set.
#
# Answer: True. remove raises a KeyError if the element is not found in the set.
# Short Answer
# What will the following code display?
#
# python
# Copy code
# dct = {'Monday': 1, 'Tuesday': 2, 'Wednesday': 3}
# print(dct['Tuesday'])
# Answer: 2 (The value associated with the key 'Tuesday')
# What will the following code display?
#
# python
# Copy code
# dct = {'Monday': 1, 'Tuesday': 2, 'Wednesday': 3}
# print(dct.get('Monday', 'Not found'))
# Answer: 1 (The value associated with the key 'Monday')
# What will the following code display?
#
# python
# Copy code
# dct = {'Monday': 1, 'Tuesday': 2, 'Wednesday': 3}
# print(dct.get('Friday', 'Not found'))
# Answer: Not found (The key 'Friday' is not in the dictionary, so the default value 'Not found' is returned)

# 5. How do you delete an element from a dictionary?
# To delete an element from a dictionary, use the del statement with the key of the item you want to remove. Hereâ€™s an example:
#
# python
# Copy code
# # Example dictionary
# stuff = {'aaa': 111, 'bbb': 222, 'ccc': 333}
#
# # Deleting the element with key 'bbb'
# del stuff['bbb']
# print(stuff)  # Output will be {'aaa': 111, 'ccc': 333}
# 6. How do you determine the number of elements that are stored in a dictionary?
# To get the number of elements in a dictionary, use the len() function. Hereâ€™s an example:
#
# python
# Copy code
# # Example dictionary
# stuff = {'aaa': 111, 'bbb': 222, 'ccc': 333}
#
# # Getting the number of elements
# num_elements = len(stuff)
# print(num_elements)  # Output will be 3
# 7. What will the following code display?
# python
# Copy code
# stuff = {'aaa': 111, 'bbb': 222, 'ccc': 333}
# print(stuff.get('ddd', 'Not Found'))
# Answer: Not Found (The key 'ddd' does not exist in the dictionary, so the default value 'Not Found' is returned)
